Welcome to pydre's documentation!
=================================

**Pydre** is a software package designed to analyze driving data taken from driving simulation research studies. Specifically, it was built around the data file format generated by SimObserver, which is software sold by Realtime Technolgies for recording data from their SimObserver simulation system. 

SimObserver collects information during the simulation drive, such as vehicle speed and following distance.  This information is collected every 1/60th of a second, which results in tens of thousands of rows for a study session. This data is often processed into specific metrics that look at trends, averages or other quantities that are determined by looking at longer periods of time. This is what Pydre was designed to do. 

Pydre takes a drive data file with data that is difficult to interpret in raw form and applies filters and metrics to create a file that can be more easily used for statistical analysis in R (or other similar tools).
