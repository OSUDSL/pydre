		---- DSL's Metrics w/ SAE International Standards References ----
		______________________________________________________

	This, here, will be a list of all of the DSL's metrics with references to each of their 
respective locations in the SAE document. In reference to the SAE International Standards doc found
on box.osu.edu as the file 'J2944_201506.pdf':

	Current DSL Metrics (found in metrics.py):
	------------------------------------------
				_____
	- colMean		     |
				     |
	- colMin		     |
				     | <----- Don't expect these to be found within SAE doc
	- colMax		     |
				     |
	- colSD			     |
				 ____|
	- meanVelocity
		-- velocity is only mentioned, it seems, in the context of accelerating or calculations
			for TTC or similar formulas within SAE documentation

	- stdDevVelocity
		-- like meanVelocity above, no mentions within SAE documentation

	- steeringEntropy <-- SAE Reference @ 9.2.4 p.84

	- tailgatingTime <-- related SAE Reference @ 8.1.4 as 'Time Headway'
		-- Tailgating not mentioned in document except for when discussing lane change urgency;
			however, time headway was the time measurement of how far a subject was from
			a lead car, within a certain range would be considered tailgating. ( I think).

	- tailgatingPercentage
		-- Nothing about percentages found, refer to metric above.

	- timeAboveSpeed
		-- Speed not really discussed in SAE docs except as mentioned above in meanVelocity

	- lanePosition <-- SAE Referenced as 'Standard deviation of lane position (SDLP)' @ 10.1.3 p.90

	- boxMetrics
		-- specific metric not expecting to find, think this had to do with reaction time tho,
			which is covered in the SAE doc @ 6.5.2 (see tbiReaction)

	- roadExits <-- related SAE Reference as 'Roadway departure' @ 10.5.2 p.115

	- brakeJerk <-- SAE Reference @ 7.2.13

	- ecoCar
		-- study specific metric, not expecting to find anything on this

	- tbiReaction <-- related SAE Reference @ 6.5.2 p.30 & 6.5.4 p.31
		-- These are the references for the general fields of "Reaction Time" & "Response Time",
			respectively. They briefly mention the guidelines for performing each of these
			in studies.

	- errorPresses
		-- Couldn't find any metrics dealing with user error in performing studies, only user 
			error in variable settings such as steering or accelerating (within SAE doc)

	- gazes <-- related SAE Reference as 'Gaze time... lane change average...' @ 10.4.1.1 p.106
		-- Very specific, but is the only mention of "gaze" in all the SAE documentation.
